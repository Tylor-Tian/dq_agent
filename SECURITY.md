# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories:

- Go to the repository Security tab.
- Choose "Report a vulnerability" (private advisory draft).
- Include reproduction steps, impact, and affected versions.

Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| 0.1.x | Yes |
| < 0.1.0 | No |

## Disclosure Process

1. We acknowledge receipt of a private report as soon as possible.
2. We validate impact and scope, then prepare a fix.
3. We coordinate a release with security notes.
4. We publish a GitHub Security Advisory once a fix is available.

We may ask reporters to keep details private until a patched release is published.
